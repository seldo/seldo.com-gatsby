            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

            <h3>My background</h3>

            <p>I grew up in Trinidad and Tobago, in the Caribbean, and lived there until I left to go to college in the UK. I stayed in London for a few years after completing my degree in computer science, then I got a job with Yahoo, who moved me to San Francisco. After 12 happy years in San Francisco my partner John and I moved to Sea Ranch full-time in July of 2020. We got married in our backyard at Sea Ranch in April last year with friends and family watching over Zoom, then this year on our 1st anniversary we finally got to celebrate with everyone in person at Spring Ranch in Mendocino.</p>

            <p>John and I work remotely from Sea Ranch. I am a "data evangelist" (like a data analyst, except I also give conference talks) at Netlify, a service that helps companies host their websites. There I analyze internal and industry data and make policy recommendations.</p>

            <p>Prior to my current job I founded a couple of startups, including one called awe.sm which was acquired in 2014 and another called "npm" which Microsoft bought in 2020.</p>

            <p>Few people outside of very specific circles in tech are familiar with npm, so I should give you some sense of scale: npm was (before it was absorbed into Microsoft) a company of 50 people, a bit smaller than TSRA. It had revenue and expenses in the region of $4-8M annually, roughly similar to TSRA. It has a product used daily by tens of millions of software developers all over the world (mostly for free, hence only $4-8M revenue!). My position at npm changed as the company grew, but I was at different times the CTO, the COO and (briefly, during the CEO's parental leave) CEO.</p>

            <p>The result of my time at npm and other start-ups is that I have experience as a board member of a corporation and the legal and financial duties entailed. I have interviewed over a thousand people over the 20+ years of my career and have hired over a hundred. I believe this experience is valuable as a board member at TSRA. At npm specifically I got used to dealing with communicating to an enormous, global user community, which is also helpful when running a large, member-driven organization like TSRA.</p>

            <h3>Why I'm running</h3>

            <p>My immediate spur for running was, as I think it was for many of this year's candidates, surprise and concern at recent increases in TSR's budget and consequent rises in dues. But if that was my only reason it wouldn't be enough to convince me to run.</p>

            <p>I enjoy helping out at the things that I'm good at, and I enjoy having a sense of community and a sense of "place". TSR has a lovely community with a long tradition of mutual aid that I admire and want to preserve and enhance. I come from a very small island, so a community where everybody knows everybody and we all look to the ocean is a very comfortable and familiar one for me. Providing high-level oversight and analysis is something my career has given me experience at, so this seemed a good fit.</p>

            <h3>My positions</h3>

            <p>I debated before running how to pick my positions, and I saw two paths:</p>

            <p><b>Option A:</b> I can poll the membership for their views on every issue and attempt to faithfully represent their views</p>

            <p><b>Option B:</b> I can hold and represent my own authentic positions, and let the democratic process decide whether residents want somebody like me with a voice in running TSR</p>

            <p>There are things to be said for both paths, but I have taken option B. Later in this document you'll see I've gone into detail on specific questions, but first let me lay out my driving principles:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Efficiency</b> - everybody wants to see TSRA run efficiently. That doesn't mean mindless penny-pinching, but if we are going to spend money we should make sure we're putting it to good use. See <a href="#q3">Q3: dues, budget and compensation</a> for more on this.</li>
                <li><b>Environmentalism</b> - "Living lightly on the land" is a principle we quote often but don't always live up to. I want to see us reduce waste, reduce our carbon footprint, and support our abundance of native plants and wildlife in ways that are safe but also beautiful. See <a href="#q9">Q9: environmentalism</a> for more on my positions.</li>
                <li><b>Diversity</b> - Sea Ranch was created to be a place for "just folks". A huge body of research exists that indicates <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/?sh=18ab0ec54cbf">organizations that are more diverse make better decisions</a>. By welcoming people from every background and including them in the decision-making process, we can make better decisions. Not in some wishy-washy "everyone feels warm and fuzzy" way, but objectively better, smarter management. (And we can <b>also</b> feel warm and fuzzy)</li>
                <li><b>Technology</b> - I can't deny that I'm a tech person, and we tech people have a deservedly mixed reputation. I believe the right way to use technology is as a tool to make our lives easier. If technology is making your life harder or less convenient, we have made the wrong choices and should revisit them. I don't want technology for its own sake, but if we can use technology to serve our higher goals -- the ones I listed above -- we should do so. In <a href="#q5">Q5: Transparency and communication</a> I go into more detail about how we can do that.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Thank you for considering me</h3>

            <p>I accept that my candidacy is probably a long-shot, and I expect that as a board member my voice would be an outlier, and not the dominant one. But that's okay. If TSR thinks adding my voice to our leadership would benefit us, I am willing to step up, and if we don't, then that's how democracy is supposed to work.</p>

            <p>The remainder of this page is a Q&A in response questions I have received over the course of the campaign.</p>

            <p><a href="#contents">Back to top</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q1">Q1: Short term rentals</h2>

            <p>I received lots of specific questions about STRs. As my general position, TSR was founded with the expectation that it would be a community of second homes, and a great number of people who currently live here, including myself, first visited as short-term renters. STRs provide residents with income, and the ability to turn a home into a short-term rental raises the value of all the properties on the ranch. It also provides flexibility, allowing people who are temporarily forced to leave TSR to be able to rent their home until they return. Longer term, introducing people to the joys of TSR as short-term rentals provides a constant trickle of new folks who want to move here, keeping the community alive and vibrant.</p>

            <p>STRs certainly can result in nuisance noise and behavior, but no more so than visiting family members or friends who might not be as familiar with the rules (and the two groups are indistinguishable when they are being annoying, leading to blame on STRs that is not always justified). The rules governing STRs are already extremely comprehensive and routinely enforced. Every community can expect visitors, whether you're San Francisco or Sea Ranch, so I see no need to try and exclude visitors, whether they are friends or renters.</p>

            <p>My biggest concern with STRs is that short-term rentals mean that longer-term rentals are harder to find, increasing housing pressure in the area, especially for those with lower incomes, but I think there are smarter ways to improve the affordability of housing than limiting rentals in a community that was literally designed with them in mind (see <a href="#q10">Q10: Staff housing shortages and ADUs</a> for more).</p>

            <p><a href="#contents">Back to top</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q2">Q2: Current management of TSRA</h2>

            <p>I received a variety of questions about the current management of TSRA, including levels of communication, job performance of the CM, the remote COO and more. I've tried to aggregate all of those into this answer.</p>

            <p>As an owner and resident for the last 2 years I have never personally heard from the CM, via email or regular mail, or indeed from TSRA apart from via InfoAlerts and a handful of surveys. In an age of effortless and free electronic communication, and a pandemic in which all other forms of interaction have been drastically curtailed, that strikes me as strange. Running a company, I learned that over-communication is essential. My rule of thumb was that anything important we'd decided or learned should be repeated at least 3 times before we could expect people to have heard it. I think the same is probably true at TSRA.</p>

            <p>I think a great deal of member dissatisfaction and the perceived performance problems with TSRA's management and administration are primarily due to a lack of transparency and communication. Difficult and complicated decisions need to be made, but must be provided along with context for people to understand them -- you have to "show your work". If there are going to be complaints about communication from TSRA to members, it should be that we communicate too often, not too rarely.</p>

            <p>With all of that said, the past 2 years have been a tremendously difficult time for everyone. Making a switch from in-person to remote work was difficult even for a tech worker such as myself during normal times; for an organization like TSRA to make the switch in a huge hurry in the middle of a once-in-a-century global health crisis, it would have been miraculous if there had not been substantial disruption. So I am inclined to give the community manager and TSRA's team the benefit of the doubt.</p>
            
            <p>I received some questions about remote positions within TSRA: as a remote worker myself, I certainly believe remote work can be effective and can also help side-step our chronic shortage of affordable housing in the area. But again, remote work during a global pandemic and remote work normally are very different things, and we should expect to see remote positions improve in their effectiveness in the coming years.</p>
            
            <p>In short: I believe we can do much better, but I do not think anybody working through the last 2 years could be expected to be performing at their best. The last 2 years have been a nightmare.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q3">Q3: Dues, budget and compensation</h2>

            <p>As I mentioned in my <a href="#introduction">introduction</a>, one of my motivations for running is the sudden increase in our HOA dues and further expected increases. We seem to be spending a great deal more than we did on legal fees, and this seems a sensible place to cut back. However, inflation and increasing housing costs have indeed forced salaries to rise, and given the large number of unfilled positions already at TSRA it seems unlikely we can cut back further there. The current increases are therefore probably going to be difficult to reverse but I certainly hope we can put the brakes on further increases for some time.</p>

            <p>The compensation of staff is a complicated question that I do not feel I yet have enough information to answer. As a board member, I would expect to have access to more data including performance evaluations and comparative salaries to judge the value for money we are getting from all of TSRA's staff.</p>

            <p>One place I think we can see significant savings is in streamlining decision-making across the board. See my next answer on <a href="#q4">process</a> for details.</p>

            <p>Another place I think we can avoid major expenditures is on additions to infrastructure: the various proposals for an expanded TSRA "campus" seem out of step with an organization that is already under-staffed and moving to hiring remotely. See also my answer on <a href="#q11">Q11: ...and, yes, pickleball</a></p>

            <p><a href="#contents">Back to top</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q4">Q4: Process and decision-making</h2>

            <p>It seems to me that a great deal of frustration members experience when interacting with TSRA revolves around process and decision making. Processes are not clear or are not followed; decisions are made, seemingly hurriedly or without consultation, and are then reversed or delayed for endless referral and study. Decision making appears opaque and arbitrary. This is frustrating for members and surely must also be for staff. Everybody wants TSRA to get on with things quickly and efficiently; the goals of staff and members are aligned.</p>

            <p><b>The core of quick and efficient operation is context, and trust</b>. Staff must feel empowered, that is, they must feel as if their managers trust them to make the right decisions. If they don't, they will avoid making decisions or taking action, or they will escalate decisions to management, creating bottlenecks among senior management, who will then complain of over-work. A healthy organization has to push decision-making as low in the organization as it can go, and trust that we have hired people who will make the right calls.</p>

            <p><b>The benefit of empowered staff is efficiency.</b> Staff who believe management has their backs will make quick decisions, which will make members happy. Happy members will lead to satisfied staff who feel appreciated and valued, which can help reverse the high rates of attrition we've seen in TSRA staff lately. In a virtuous cycle, happy and efficient staff will get more done in less time, saving the association money and further delighting members.</p>

            <p><b>Efficient decision making also requires context.</b> By context, I mean full awareness of the facts and constraints that apply to every decision. Members must know who is making a decision, what the rules are, and what the facts are: what are the budget constraints? What are the legal restrictions? What other factors are at play? Likewise, staff should also have the full context: who is making a request? Who will be affected by the decision they're making? What are the alternatives? The result of a decision where everyone has context should ideally always be a formality and <b>never a surprise</b>; decisions that are a surprise are almost always unwelcome.</p>

            <p>This kind of efficient, empowered, happy organization relies on efficient communication; see <a href="#q5">Q5: transparency and communication</a> for more on this.</p>

            <p>In TSRA's case, especially when it comes to the water company, many of our activities are legally regulated. This is not incompatible with empowered and efficient decision-making; see <a href="#q6">Q6: legal challenges</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="#contents">Back to top</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q5">Q5: Transparency and communication</h2>

            <p>As I mentioned in <a href="#q4">my previous answer</a>, the key to an efficient organization is being able to work quickly (and an organization that works quickly will also be more cost efficient) but also correctly. Making the right decisions quickly requires context, and context requires excellent communication.</p>

            <p>In an internet-connected world communication costs almost nothing, and this is a huge benefit to large, dispersed organizations such as TSRA's membership. It should be effortless for anyone at TSRA to find out how to get a question answered, who will be making a decision, what the rules are around that decision, and what other factors are at play when they make a request. Likewise, staff at TSRA should find it simple to know what members want, how many of them want it, and how important one request is versus another.</p>

            <p>The job of a community manager should not be making every decision, it should be putting the processes in place to make sure information is going where it should, when it should, so that staff can make the correct decisions the first time. Any other way creates slowdowns, bottlenecks, over-work and mistakes. If TSRA is running efficiently, you should know before you make a request what the answer is going to be: you should already have access to what the rules are, what the budgets are, what the constraints are. The answer should be a formality, and never a surprise. Surprising decisions nearly always make people unhappy.</p>

            <p>Key to this ideal of instant and effortless communication are our communication channels: regular mail, email and our website. The TSRA website has been given a substantial visual refresh in the last few years, and it has been a step forward in many ways, but it is still not serving the needs of our membership. Members routinely complain that they cannot find basic information. I think a little extra effort here, to make information easier to find and also to ensure everything is on the website in the first place and in a timely manner, would go a long way.</p>

            <p>TSRA's InfoAlerts are excellent: timely, concise and regular as clockwork, full of only the most important points. However, for those who would like more information -- what are committees up to, what decisions are being considered, how far along in a process a decision is -- information is either buried in board minutes or, even worse, video recordings of meetings. More proactive broadcasting of what TSRA's staff are up to up and down the org chart would do a lot to improve everyone's context and reduce frustration and surprises while improving efficiency.</p>

            <p>And finally, not everyone wants to use email or the website. As an inclusive and accessible organization TSRA should absolutely be catering to the needs of its members, including their communication needs. If you want to receive paper notices of everything, it should be simple and cost-free to do so (but not the default, both for cost reasons and simply because most people do not want to know all the details).</p>

            <p>Increasing levels of communication and transparency across the board like this can, if handled poorly, create a huge burden on TSRA administration: nobody wants to spend their whole life constantly updating websites. However, judicious use of electronic records and automation can minimize the amount of manual effort required to make information easily available as soon as it is created, without any additional steps. <b>Transparency can and should be automatic.</b></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q6">Q6: Legal challenges</h2>

            <p>As an HOA, as a water company, and as a steward of the land, many of TSRA's activities are legally regulated. That does not mean we need to get a lawyer involved every time we make a decision. As I mentioned in <a href="#q4">Q4: process and decision-making</a>, decision makers should be empowered by having all the information they need to do their jobs. If that means having an understanding of the legal framework in which they operate, then that is <b>part of the job</b> and not something that should be routinely referred to counsel.</p>
            
            <p>Counsel's job should be to create a framework outlining the rules under which we operate, in a way that the decision-makers on the ground can easily follow: a one-time task, with occasional refreshes in response to changing regulations, not an everyday routine. This is how we reduce legal bills while remaining entirely within the law.</p>

            <p>Our responsibility to obey environmental regulations is in particular a challenge when considering new infrastructure such as solar panels; see <a href="#q9">Q9: Environmentalism, including solar power and forest management</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="#contents">Back to top</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q7">Q7: The role of the board</h2>

            <p>Half a dozen people have asked me the same question about the board: what role do I believe it should play? Many are concerned about the board being a rubber stamp, others are concerned about the board micro-managing the association staff. These are both valid concerns.</p>

            <p>The role of TSRA's board, like any board, is oversight: the staff of TSRA execute day to day, the Community Manager makes sure the staff are being correctly allocated and directed, and the board ensures that the results of this action are aligned with the desires of, in TSRA's case, the members.</p>

            <p>To perform the role of oversight adequately the board needs information about what's going on. Conveniently, everyone else needs exactly this same information (see <a href="#q5">Q5: transparency and communication</a>). The board's requirements for detail about day to day operations are exactly the same that the staff and members of TSRA already need, and that TSRA should already be automatically generating and providing. Board-level reporting should present no burden, because with a few rare exceptions for confidentiality reasons that information should be available to everyone at TSRA.</p>

            <p>The role of the board, therefore, should be to spend the time required to scrutinize this information in detail. TSRA does not need every member to read the minutes of every meeting to avoid nasty surprises and unwelcome policy shifts. The volunteers on the board should be the ones taking on this task. When policies seem to be shifting away from the preferences of the membership, or processes seem to be slow or wasteful, the board can and should expect accountability from the community manager to improve execution. Ultimately, if the board believes TSRA administration is consistently failing to align with the needs and preferences of the membership, it would be appropriate and responsible for the board to replace the community manager, but this step should not be taken lightly or hastily.</p>

            <p>This answer dovetails nicely with a related question about the number and duration of board meetings. I consider lengthy and frequent board meetings a sign of dysfunction: meetings are for making decisions about information you already have. They should not require lengthy presentations of information, because that information should be available to all members and not just the board. Very few board level decisions should require "closed doors".</p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q8">Q8: My qualifications and experience at TSR</h2>

            <p>Several people have pointed out that, apart from joining the disaster response team for unit 13 where we live, I have not previously volunteered on any TSR task forces and committees, and have questioned whether living here full time for only two years gives me enough experience in how TSR works to be part of the board.</p>

            <p>This is a completely legitimate concern, and if you think I need more time at TSR before I can usefully volunteer my executive experience, then you should absolutely pick another candidate. I do not have any particular burning ambition to be part of the TSR board, I am simply following the long-standing Sea Ranch tradition of volunteerism. Boards are what I have a lot of experience with, so the board is what I'm volunteering for.</p>

            <p>The Sea Ranch board comes with significant fiduciary and legal responsibilities, but (see my <a href="#introduction">introduction</a>) not orders of magnitude greater in scope or complexity than my previous working experience, in terms of budget, size of team or legal complexity.</p>

            <p><a href="#contents">Back to top</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h2 id="q9">Q9: Environmentalism, including solar power and forest management</h2>

            <p>The principle of "living lightly on the land" is I think near and dear to the hearts of everyone at TSR. To me, this principle means several things, in order of priority:</p>

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reducing all waste, including our energy usage</li>
                <li>Maintaining a beautiful, low-touch natural environment</li>
                <li>Minimizing our land footprint</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>Arguments about solar panels at TSR are long-standing and very repetitive. My position is that solar energy is good for the environment, that solar energy is most efficient when it is produced as near as possible to where it is consumed, and that solar panels are attractive signs of hope for the future.</p>

            <p>Because of principles 2 and 3, the best place to put solar is on top of existing buildings: roofs are already dark materials at an angle, and changing that material from roof tiles to black glass is going to be aesthetically neutral at worst. We should put panels on every roof TSRA owns, and expedite and assist homeowners who want to install panels on their own property.</p>

            <p>Placement of larger solar arrays presents regulatory and environmental problems that have been long discussed, but I believe we can and should locate sites on existing, out of the way parcels owned by TSRA to house one or more arrays.</p>

            <p>All of this assumes that these solar installations make financial sense. We are a place to live, not an environmentalism charity. Reducing our energy footprint is nearly always going to pay off both environmentally and financially, but if we cannot make the math work we should not be installing solar for its own sake.</p>

            <p>As for forest protection: when TSR was founded the ranch had been logged to within an inch of its life, as historical records show. Since then we have allowed a delightful wooded paradise to spring up. We should absolutely continue this tradition, and never allow commercial logging within TSR.</p>

            <p>For reasons of fire safety, however, it would be imprudent for us to simply allow the forest to "go wild". Climate change is driving bigger and more dangerous wildfires, and we can and must maintain our forests to properly control fuel loads and moisture levels. This can be done gradually, continuously and without major disruption, in the same way that we currently maintain our network of trails by clearing fallen trees.</p>
            
            <p>I personally would have had no problem with accepting money from polluters to maintain our forests, a service we are currently providing to the state for free, but since that option is no longer on the table the point is moot.</p>

            <h2 id="q10">Q10: Staff housing shortages and ADUs</h2>

            <p>Both Sea Ranch specifically and the Gualala area in general have a chronic shortage of housing, especially for long-term renters. In Gualala's case they are limited by problems with their water infrastructure; thanks to far-sighted planning TSRA does not have the same intense limitations.</p>

            <p>The housing shortage raises property values at TSR but also hurts residents day to day: it increases the cost of services, and makes it difficult both to hire and retain staff. We've seen the impact in the closure of local businesses, recurring problems with staff retention at RCMS, and problems retaining staff at TSRA itself. It also presents a problem for long-term residents in need of carers, who cannot find care or house carers once found.</p>

            <p>I believe we can address this by a measured increase in density at TSR. I think a combination of mostly small lot sizes and time-honored and treasured design considerations that make TSR special mostly preclude stand-alone Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) for most houses at TSR, but that should be taken case-by-case. Junior ADUs (such as garage conversions) seem much more likely to work with existing footprint and design limitations.</p>

            <p>We can provide affordable housing without drastically changing the character of TSR, and it would be in all our interests to do so. I think Junior ADUs should be allowed and stand-alone ADUs at least considered, and would support a rule making that clear.</p>

            <h2 id="q11">Q11: ...and, yes, pickleball</h2>

            <p>My short answer is that we should allow people to play pickleball. The tennis courts seem to have more than enough slack to give up some of them to another sport, and in the event that the situation changes in future years, re-painting some lines and moving a net around won't break the bank. What <b>would</b> break the bank is building a whole new set of courts that nobody wants to pay for solely because tennis players don't feel like sharing their toys.</p>

            <p>More important, however, is what the pickleball debate represents. We have (apparently) spent literally years arguing about this, with board-level involvement. What we use our tennis courts for does not seem like an issue that should have ever risen to the attention of the board in the first place, and can be reasonably solved by gathering basic data about how much the courts are used and how often people want to play pickleball. The amount of high-level, expensive time used up by this issue contributes directly to our greater need for staff and raises all of our dues.</p>

            <p>I believe our inability to resolve the pickleball question is merely a symptom of deeper dysfunction, which I believe is what we should really address. For more on how I would do that, please see my answers on <a href="#q4">process and decision-making</a>, <a href="#q5">transparency and communcation</a> and <a href="#q7">the role of the board</a>.</p>
